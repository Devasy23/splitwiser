## Screen Implementation Metrics

| Category | Planned | Implemented | Completion Rate |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Authentication | 4 | 1 | 25% |
| Core App | 20+ | 1 | ~5% |
| Groups | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| Expenses | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| Balances | 4 | 0 | 0% |
| Profile | 5 | 0 | 0% |
| **Total** | **45+** | **2** | **~4%** |

## Conclusion

The current Splitwiser mobile app is in early development stage with only basic authentication and a placeholder home screen implemented. While the foundation is solid with proper authentication flow and project structure, significant development is needed to achieve the full bill-splitting functionality.

The implemented screens demonstrate good code quality, proper React Native patterns, and professional UI design. The next development phase should focus on implementing core navigation structure and essential screens for groups and expense management.
