3. **Testing Setup**: Establish testing framework
4. **Component Extraction**: Create reusable component library

### Technology Stack Enhancements
**Current Stack (Good)**:
- React Native 0.72.10
- Expo 49.0.15
- TypeScript 5.1.3
- React Navigation 6.1.9

**Recommended Additions**:
```json
{
  "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.x.x",
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^4.x.x",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.x.x",
  "react-native-paper": "^5.x.x",
  "@testing-library/react-native": "^12.x.x"
}
```

### Architecture Evolution
**Current**: Context API + Local State
**Recommended**: Context API + React Query + Component Library

```typescript
// Recommended structure evolution
src/
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
├── screens/          # Feature-based screen organization
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks for logic reuse
├── services/         # API integration layers
├── contexts/         # Global state management
└── utils/            # Shared utilities
```
