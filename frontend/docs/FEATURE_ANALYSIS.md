   - Without groups, users cannot organize expenses
   - Fundamental to bill-splitting concept
   - Required for any expense operations

2. **Expense Management** (Priority 1)
   - Core feature of the application
   - Essential for bill-splitting functionality
   - Users cannot add or track expenses

3. **Balance Calculations** (Priority 1)
   - Key value proposition of the app
   - Users need to see who owes what
   - Settlement suggestions are essential

### Important Missing Features (Enhanced Functionality)

4. **Navigation Structure** (Priority 2)
   - Current navigation is too limited
   - Users need to access different sections
   - Tab navigation is expected pattern

5. **Data Persistence** (Priority 2)

- ✅ User management endpoints
- 🔄 Groups endpoints (backend exists, frontend not connected)
- 🔄 Expenses endpoints (backend exists, frontend not connected)

### Required Frontend Integration
The backend appears to have more functionality than the frontend uses:

1. **Groups API Integration**
   - GET /groups (list user's groups)
   - POST /groups (create group)
   - GET /groups/{id} (group details)
   - PUT /groups/{id} (update group)
   - DELETE /groups/{id} (delete group)

2. **Expenses API Integration**
   - POST /expenses (add expense)
   - GET /expenses (list expenses)
   - GET /expenses/{id} (expense details)
   - PUT /expenses/{id} (update expense)
   - DELETE /expenses/{id} (delete expense)

- ❌ No automated testing
- ❌ No error tracking
- ❌ No analytics
- ❌ No performance monitoring

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Focus on Core Features**: Groups and expenses are essential
2. **Improve Navigation**: Users need to access different sections
3. **Backend Integration**: Leverage existing backend APIs
4. **Testing Strategy**: Implement testing as features are built

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Component Library**: Build reusable components
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track app performance
3. **User Feedback**: Implement feedback collection
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automate testing and deployment

## Conclusion

The Splitwiser mobile app has a solid foundation with excellent authentication implementation, but it's missing the core bill-splitting functionality that defines its purpose. The authentication system demonstrates good architectural decisions and code quality, providing confidence that the remaining features can be built to the same standard.

**Key Insights**:
- Authentication is production-ready
- Backend APIs appear to be available
- UI/UX patterns are established
- Navigation needs significant expansion
- Core features (groups, expenses, balances) are the primary development focus

**Success Metrics for Next Phase**:
- Users can create and manage groups
- Users can add and split expenses
- Users can view balances and settlements
- Navigation supports all major features
- Data persists and syncs properly
