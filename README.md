### Key Services
1. **Authentication Service**: Secure login with email/password and Google OAuth
2. **User Service**: Profile management and preferences
3. **Group Service**: Group creation, member management, and invitations
4. **Expense Service**: Expense tracking, splitting algorithms, and attachments
5. **Settlement Service**: Payment recording and debt resolution
6. **Notification Service**: Real-time updates and notifications

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Expo CLI
- MongoDB (for backend)
- Python 3.9+ (for backend)

### Development Setup

#### Frontend (Expo App)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### Mobile Development

**Android**: Android previews are defined as a `workspace.onStart` hook and started as a vscode task when the workspace is opened/started.

Note, if you can't find the task, either:
- Rebuild the environment (using command palette: `IDX: Rebuild Environment`), or
- Run `npm run android -- --tunnel` command manually run android and see the output in your terminal. The device should pick up this new command and switch to start displaying the output from it.

In the output of this command/task, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You'll also find options to open the app's developer menu, reload the app, and more.

**Web**: Web previews will be started and managed automatically. Use the toolbar to manually refresh.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

#### Backend (FastAPI)

1. **Set up Python environment**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your MongoDB connection string and other config
   ```

4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
#### Proof-of-Concept UI (Streamlit)

This project includes a Streamlit UI for demonstration purposes, available on the `ui-poc` branch.

1.  **Switch Branch**: Ensure you are on the `ui-poc` branch (`git checkout ui-poc`).
2.  **Start Backend**: Make sure the backend server is running.
3.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the UI directory and install its requirements:
    ```bash
    cd ui 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run UI**: Start the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
