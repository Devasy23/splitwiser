## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or comments.**

The security and privacy of our users are our highest priority. We encourage you to report any potential vulnerabilities directly and privately to our maintainers.

**How to Report:**

1.  **Email Us:** Please send details to **[devasy23@gmail.com](mailto:devasy23@gmail.com)**.
2.  **Describe the Issue:** To help us triage the issue quickly, please include:
    -   The type of vulnerability (e.g., "SQL Injection", "XSS").
    -   The full URL or code component where the vulnerability was found.
    -   A detailed description of the steps to reproduce the issue.
    -   Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or requests that demonstrate the exploit.
    -   The potential impact of the vulnerability.

**What to Expect:**

-   **Within 48 hours:** You will receive an acknowledgment of your report.
-   We will work with you to understand and validate the reported issue.
-   We will keep you informed as we work on a fix and plan its release.
-   We will notify you when the vulnerability is resolved and will happily credit you for your discovery (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

We deeply appreciate any effort to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly. Thank you for helping us keep SplitWiser and its users safe.

## 🔓 Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** process:
1.  The vulnerability is reported and privately confirmed.
2.  A fix is developed and tested.
3.  The fix is deployed to all supported versions.
4.  A security advisory is published on GitHub, detailing the vulnerability and crediting the researcher.

This process typically takes **30-90 days** from report to public disclosure to ensure users are protected while a fix is developed.
