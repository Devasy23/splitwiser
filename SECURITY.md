# 🔒 Security Polspliticy

Thank you for your interest in keeping the `splitwiser` project secure. This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities, what to expect after reporting, and how we handle disclosures.

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open an issue** on GitHub.

Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email the maintainer directly**
2. Include the following details:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (if possible)
   - Potential impact
   - Any mitigation or workaround suggestions

---

## 🚫 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We ask that you:
- Do not publicly disclose the issue until it has been resolved.
- Avoid testing vulnerabilities in a way that could disrupt services.
- Act in good faith and with respect for user data and privacy.

---

## 📃 Disclosure Policy

- We follow a **coordinated disclosure** approach.
- We appreciate responsible reporting and will publicly disclose the issue only **after a fix has been released**.
---

## 🔄 Security Fixes & Releases

Security fixes will be merged into `main` and any supported release branches. We will publish release notes describing the fix and migration steps when required.

---

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

We value the contributions from the community and encourage responsible disclosure to help keep `splitwiser` safe and secure for all users.
